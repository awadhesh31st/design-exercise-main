# FormKit - Visual Form Builder

FormKit is a **drag-and-drop visual form builder** built with **Next.js 15, React 19, Tailwind 4, and Zustand**. It allows users to create custom forms by dragging components onto a canvas, configuring their properties, and instantly previewing results.  

This project focuses on **design engineering** â€” blending **aesthetic sensibility**, **delightful interactions**, and **polished frontend engineering**.
